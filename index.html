                    <p>In 2015, Last Days in the Desert, a film written and directed by Rodrigo Garc√≠a, received the Dolby Family Sound Fellowship and premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in Dolby Atmos.</p>
                    <p>The fellowship provided an incredible opportunity to elevate our work in the film's soundtrack and to create a truly immersive experience for the audience. Under the mentorship of Academy Award-winning sound designer Skip Lievsay, we were able to explore ways in which the technology behind Dolby Atmos could be implemented to heighten the storytelling in this beautiful film.</p>
                    <p>Feel free to take a look at a short film about our experience working with this powerful technology</p>
